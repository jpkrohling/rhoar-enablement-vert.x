= Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtime - Jaeger Agent as sidecar
:toc: macro

This example is based on the link:https://github.com/rhoar-enablement/vert.x[Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtime Vert.x example]
and adds distributed tracing support via Jaeger by:

* Adding a tracer initialization routine in the verticle constructor
* Wraps the HTTP requests in a span

== Running

=== Bare metal

Start Jaeger
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --rm \
    --name jaeger \
    -p6831:6831/udp \
    -p16686:16686 \
    jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.6
----

Run the application with sampling set to 1, to record all incoming requests:
[source,bash]
----
JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE=const JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM=1 mvn clean vertx:run
----

And call the HTTP endpoint:
[source,bash]
----
curl localhost:8080
----

A trace with a single span should now be available at link:http://localhost:16686[Jaeger] and should look
like this:

=== OpenShift

Coming soon.
